ELLA: A Code Coverage Tool for Android APK's 
====

ELLA is a tool to instrument Android APK's to collect
coverage. Several tools exist that can instrument APK's to some
degree. But they usually do not work very reliably because they
translate Dalvik bytecodes to another form such as Java bytecode or
internal representations of other tools, and this translation is quite
challenging.  Thus, EMMA's approach is to instrument at the Dalvik
bytecode level. It does so by using the great DexLib2 library (a part
of the [Smali](https://github.com/JesusFreke/smali) project).
